## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of sales data from a coffee vending machine. The goal is to uncover actionable insights regarding **customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, payment preferences**, and **product popularity**.  
The findings are intended to support data-driven decision-making and optimize the vending machine's operational efficiency and profitability.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Coffee Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/data)
- **Description:** Includes transactional data such as **date, product sold, payment type, card ID, transaction amount**, and **time of purchase**.

## Key Insights
- 💳 **Preferred Payment Method:** Card payments dominate over cash transactions.
- ☕ **Top-Selling Beverages:** **Latte** and **Americano with Milk** lead as the most popular items.
- 🕒 **Peak Sales Hours:** Morning hours, particularly between **9 AM and 11 AM**, record the highest transaction volume.
- 📅 **Sales Distribution:** Sales are stronger on weekdays, with distinct patterns observed across different months.
- 🎯 **Customer Retention:** A small subset of loyal customers is responsible for a significant proportion of repeat purchases.
